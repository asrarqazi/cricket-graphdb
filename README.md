# Cricket-O-Graph
## The Cricketing Graph Database 

This project is my attempt of using Graph Databases to analyze cricket data, and try and answer questions that prove the utility of graph databases when you are thinking of solving real world problems

## Background
My desire to learn Graph Database comes from my eagerness to use it with Healthcare data. There are may articles out there, that advocate the use of graph databases to answer many healthcare related questions. Before I jump in to use graph databases to answer some healthcare questions, I wanted to get my hands dirty with graph databases. 

And what better way of getting your hands dirty, than using it for something that you love. 

Growing up, I would pride myself in knowing a lot of cricket statistics. My first addiction to data was knowing these cricket stats and rattle them off during any relevant cricket conversations.
